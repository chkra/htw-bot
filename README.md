# Simple Text Based Chat Bot for a Website

## About

This repository shows a simple proof-of-concept for a ChatGPT-based Chat Bot. We use llama_index to fine tune ChatGPT with data from the website of the _Hochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin_. 

Right now, the data (found in `htw-data/htw-data.txt` contains only a few sentences and was scraped manually (!). In the demo shown below, we ask specifically for content mentioned in this text file.

## Local Setup

Make environment and setup dependencies:
```
conda create --name htw-bot python=3.11
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You need to replace the ChatGPT API Key in `app.py` with your own key to get the code running. You can request your own API Key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) at OpenAI.

Run Flask demo:
```
python app.py
```
Move to to URL in your browser to see the demo.


## Next steps

This is only a proof of concept, obviously. Several improvements are necessary to gain a production-ready app:
* replace ChatGPT model with offline LLaMA model to proof on-premise capabilities
* scrape information from HTW website to build a suitable knowledge base for `llama_index`.
